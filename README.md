# AuthorsPage

One common aspect of web development is learning how to fetch data from an external API, then work with asynchronous JavaScript.

This freeCodeCamp authors page project will show me how to use the fetch method, then dynamically update the DOM to display the fetched data.

This project will also teach me how to paginate data so my project can load results in batches.
